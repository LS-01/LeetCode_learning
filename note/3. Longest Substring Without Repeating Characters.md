### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```


Example 2:

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```


Example 3:

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```



python3:

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        longest = 0
        s_set = {}
        count = 0
        i = 0
        last_save = 0
        while i < len(s):
            st = s[i]
            j = s_set.get(st)
            if j is not None and j >= last_save:
                if count > longest:
                    longest = count
                count = i - j
                s_set[st] = i
                last_save = j + 1
            else:
                count = count + 1
                s_set[st] = i
            i = i + 1
        if count > longest:
            longest = count
        return longest
```
